# Fleet DMS Backend Cloud Deployment

## Configuration Complete!

Your backend is now prepared for Google Cloud deployment. The database connection test was successful, and all necessary configuration files have been created.

## Next Steps for Deployment

Before you can deploy, you'll need to install the Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI). Here's what you need to do:

1. **Install Google Cloud SDK**
   - Download and install from: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
   - After installation, run `gcloud init` to authenticate and set up your project

2. **Create a Google Cloud Project** (if you haven't already)
   - Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Note your Project ID for deployment

3. **Enable Required APIs**
   - Cloud Run API
   - Container Registry API
   - Cloud Build API
   
   You can enable these with:
   ```
   gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com containerregistry.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com
   ```

4. **Deploy to Cloud Run**
   - Once Google Cloud SDK is installed, you can deploy using our deployment script:
   ```
   cd backend
   ./deploy.sh --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID --db-url="postgresql://fastapi_user:Lola443710!@34.173.189.227:5432/backend" --secret-key="7e9c8a3b5d2f1e0a6c4b9d2e5f8a7c1b3d6e9f2a5c8b7d4e1f6a9c2b5d8e3f7a"
   ```

Alternatively, you can deploy directly from the Google Cloud Console:

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Navigate to Cloud Run
3. Click "Create Service"
4. Choose "Continuously deploy from a repository" option
5. Connect your GitHub repository
6. Configure the build to use the Dockerfile in the backend directory
7. Set environment variables (DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY, SAMSARA_API_KEY)
8. Deploy the service

## Testing Your Deployment

Once deployed, you should be able to access your API at the provided Cloud Run URL:

- `/` - Root endpoint with API information
- `/health` - Health check endpoint
- `/readiness` - Database readiness check
- `/docs` - Swagger documentation

For detailed information, refer to the `cloud_deployment_guide.md` file.
